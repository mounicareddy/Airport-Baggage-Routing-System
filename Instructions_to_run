The output is the optimal routing to get bags to their destinations. Bags with with flight id of "ARRIVAL" are routed to baggage claim.

Specifications:
Eclipse IDE (Version: Eclipse Java Oxygen)
JavaSE-1.8 

Time complexity:
As i have choosen adjacency matrix for implementing this problem time complexity is O(V^2).
Based on neccessity adjacency matrix can be replaced with adjacency List whose time complexity is O(E logV)
where v is Vertex
E is Edge

Steps to run the application:
1.Import the project into Eclipse/any IDE
 File->Import->General->Existing projects into workspace
2. Run the application
  Run->Run as->java Application
3.Output is generated in the console.

I have saved input and output in a file result.txt. please find it.

Thank you!
